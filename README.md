# simplediff

A simple program to diff two files.
I chose to use clojure because I didn't know clojure before, and thought this was a good opportunity to try it out.

## build, run, test

Need lein installed.
I developed this on ubuntu linux., but it should work on windows or mac OS.

* https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
